# Numerical Experiments for the thesis *Multi-Objective Approaches for the Thesis Seminar Timetabling Problem*

This repository contains the code and numerical experiments for the Masters thesis titled *Multi-Objective Approaches for the Thesis Seminar Timetabling Problem*. The experiments are implemented using Python and MiniZinc, and the results presented in the thesis are reproduced here. The details of the models and algorithms can be found in the thesis.

## Repository Structure

- `MOILP for the TSTP/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook used for running the experiments for the Multi-Objective Integer Linear Programming (MOILP) models for the TSTP.
- `MOSA for the TSTP/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook used for running the experiments for the Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) for the TSTP.
- `MiniZinc for the TSTP/`: Contains the MOILP model files using the weighted-sum technique and the data files of the artificial instances for the TSTP impelemented in MiniZinc.
- `Results/`: Pre-generated results for users to quickly view without re-running the full experiments.

## Requirements

To replicate the experiments or run the notebooks, you will need the following software:

- **Python 3.11**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Gurobi Optimizer version 11.0.0**
- **Required Python Libraries**
- **The MiniZinc IDE (version 2.8.3 or higher)**
